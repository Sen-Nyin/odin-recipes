        <h2>Delicious duck burger, melting vacherin cheese in a brioche bun with girolle mushrooms</h2>
        <p>This is a burger like no other: a melting scoop of Vacherin cheese encased in minced duck meat and served in
            a brioche bun with girolle mushrooms. Delish.</p>

        <p>Equipment and preparation: You will need a mincer for this recipe (alternatively, ask your butcher to mince
            the duck meat).</p>

        <h3>Ingredients - Burger</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large duck breasts</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Vacherin cheese, scopped from the middle</li>
            <li>2 banana shallots, peeled and sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>250g girolle mushrooms, cleaned</li>
            <li>2 brioche buns</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients - Chips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 King Edward potatoes, cleaned and chipped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the duck burger, roughly remove about two-thirds of the fat from each duck breast and then chop them
                into chunks and pass through a mincer. Season the meat well and form into two balls using your hands.
            </li>
            <li>Take one ball of meat and push a scoop of Vacherin into the centre. Form the meat around the Vacherin
                and pat down a little to make a classic burger shape. Repeat with the remaining ball and scoop of
                cheese.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 160C/325F (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous: Do not leave
                unattended.)</li>
            <li>Rinse the chipped potatoes under cold running water to remove any excess starch. Dry thoroughly on a
                clean tea towel and then place into the hot oil to cook for about 8-10 minutes. The chips should begin
                to lightly colour on the outside and be soft enough to crush between your fingers.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the chips from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen
                paper. Increase the oil temperature to 180C/350F</li>
            <li>In the meantime, heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Once hot, add the burgers and fry for 3-4 minutes
                on each side until nicely cooked on each side and just cooked through in the middle. If you like your
                burger fully cooked through, place in a hot oven for a few minutes to finish. Otherwise, place the
                burgers on to a plate to rest.</li>
            <li>Place the sliced shallots onto the hot griddle to caramelise. Cook for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a separate pan over a high heat. Add the mushrooms and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until
                just softened.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to eat, add the chips to the hot oil and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown
                and crisp. Remove and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.</li>
            <li>Serve the duck burgers with the shallots and mushrooms in a brioche bun.</li>
